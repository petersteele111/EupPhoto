# EUP Photography
This is my professional website for my photography work. This will be were clients can create accounts, view their photo shoots, select images they want edited or retouched, and download digital copies. I will also implement and integrate in the ability to order prints and various products directly on my website as well. 

## Languages Used
This site is mostly going to be PHP but is built off Laravel as a framework and uses Alpine.js and tailwindcss as well.
